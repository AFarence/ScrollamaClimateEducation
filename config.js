'<p>To teach it, he uses a photo taken by a friend on the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds. The fairgrounds are a few miles south of where he grew up, and the building shows high water marks from four different floods in the area. The most recent line almost touches the building’s roof.</p>' +
'<p>“I\'ve grown up here in Pennsylvania. I moved here when I was in first grade. I know Pennsylvania. And I\'ve seen the changes,” he said. “I tell the kids, ‘If you warm the atmosphere and you add more moisture, that water\'s going to come down eventually. And that\'s what you\'re seeing now in these floods.”</p>'

  "<p>Elmhurst Hospital Center has been identified as one of the hospitals most overwhelmed by the number of patients with COVID-19 it has received. Located in a low-middle-income area of the city, with a median household income of around $50,000, the hospital serves one of the most diverse and immigrant dense areas of the city. The three subway stations around the hospital have all seen relatively small change in their usage compare to the rest of the city.</p>";

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>As can be seen in the chart above, subway usage collapsed abruptly right after the first COVID-19 case was documented in the city. It was in fact the declaration of a state of emergency, on March 7, 2020, that precipitated this near total drop in subway ridership.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>After a few weeks of the declaration of state of emergency, subway usage in the city reached its lowest point, almost 90% less than the same time period the year before. Since then, the number of people that use the subway has remained drastically low. Even after the city began its re-opening scheme on June 8, 2020, subway usage was still more than 70% below 2019 levels.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>This difference, however, varies across the city, with some parts of it seeing a much steeper decline and others witnessing a stronger recovery. Nevertheless, even a year after the pandemic first hit New York City, the number of daily subway commuters remains below 2019 levels.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>That being said, other transportation networks have fared differently. For example, after a similar decline right after the state of emergency was declared, Citibike has seen its number of users reach and even surpass 2019 levels. City buses, on the other hand, also remain underutilized compared to their usage pre-pandemic.</p>";

  "<p>The South Bronx, perennially marred in social injustice, has also been hard hit during the current COVID-19 outbreak. The area's three main neighborhoods, Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris are mostly home to low-income families that have been forced to continue going to work, risking their health and that of their loved ones. Similarly to Jackson Heights in Queens, the areas subway stations have seen a smaller decrease in use than the rest of the city. Median household income in this area oscillates between $15,000 and $30,000.</p>";
