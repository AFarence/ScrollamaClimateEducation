"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>The report evaluated how climate change is addressed in the NGSS standards adopted by each state, and in the science standards of those who didn’t. Researchers assigned each state a score based on the inclusion of four principles: climate change is real; it’s caused by human activity; it’s affecting nature and society and it's possible to mitigate the effects. </p>" +
"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>“The bigger problem, obviously, in a lot of states, is that they just really don't talk about climate change much at all.

"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Some of the most populous states earned a D+ or lower. Six of these states, including Pennsylvania and Texas, received a failing grade.

"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>“There’s really great progress being made, but in patches across the US, and then you still have states who are not even talking about it and denying the human causes of climate change,” said Christina Kwauk, a social scientist and climate change education at the Brookings Institute. “It's a huge spectrum.”</p>" +
"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>But what happens in the classroom doesn’t totally depend on the state’s standards. Standards outline the state's expectations for teaching and learning, but it is the curriculum that determines how the content is being taught, and that varies according to the district.</p>" +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“Even though there are [NGSS] standards in place in some states, it\'s not always clear that those are standards that are really being addressed in a meaningful way in the classroom,” said Sarah Bodor, director of policy and affiliate relations at North American Association for Environmental Education.</p>' +
"<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>While districts determine the curriculum, the standards guide statewide testing, which evaluates students’ performance at each grade level. In states that require teaching climate change, the standardized assessments will test students’ knowledge on the topic. But for those that don’t address it, there is no way of measuring how much those students know about the topic.</p>" +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“Learning outcomes are essential for climate leadership, for climate engagement, civic participation, things that will make a difference, and help us hold the education system accountable to making that difference”, said Kwauk. “We really need to focus on developing those indicators and those measurement frameworks.”</p>'

'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Ninth grade biology teacher, Jackie Falcone, also teaches the human impact of climate change. In Pennsylvania, biology classes follow the content included in the Biology Keystone Exam, an end-of-the-year assessment which informs the material Falcone includes in her lessons. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Though the content in the exam doesn’t specifically address human-caused climate change, Falcone chooses to emphasize its influence on the topics she covers in class. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“I like to make them understand that all of this is connected,” Falcone said. “Even just talking about severe storms, and the tornadoes that have been happening more frequently around here, like all of that is very tangible for the students.”</p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">But not all teachers at Springfield promote instruction on the human impact of climate change. Falcone has received pushback from a social studies teacher at the school, and she said she occasionally “picks on this other teacher” as part of a “running joke.” In the past, she’s also detected some doubt from students.</p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“Some of the students have definitely asked questions where you can understand that they\'re coming from a place of preconceived notions of climate change, and it being political,” Falcone said.</p>'
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">But climate deniers or skeptics are not the majority. At least 78% of Pennsylvania residents believe schools should teach about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to global warming, according to Yale Climate Opinion Maps published last year.</p>'

let divChapter6 =
"<h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>" +
"<p>Like Vandenberg and Falcone note, communities in Pennsylvania are already experiencing the effects of climate change, and they’re expected to worsen as temperatures rise. Worst case climate projections show Pennsylvania will warm by almost 10 degrees if no actions are taken to mitigate climate change, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 model.</p>"


let divChapter7 =
"<h3 style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Looking to the Future</h3>" +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Governor Tom Wolf’s 2021 Climate Impacts Report published in May, confirms the rising average temperature projections and the increased occurrences of heatwaves. Pennsylvania is also considered at high risk for flooding, and the report predicts an 8% increase in precipitation by midcentury, primarily in the form of more frequent heavy and extreme rainfall events.</p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">"It is important to address climate change in the classrooms because today\'s students are tomorrow\'s citizens, and they have to face the challenges presented by the warming world,” said Branch. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Pennsylvania’s state science standards are nearly two decades old and don’t acknowledge climate change at all. But in the fall of 2019, the state began the process of reviewing and updating them. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">The proposed standards have been modeled by the NGSS, so they require explicit teaching about climate change. But scientists and advocates have identified a key backdrop in the revision: it downplays the human responsibility for the warming of the planet, which the NGSS emphasized in a clarification statement. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">The revision was released for a month-long public comment period that ended in July. </p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“The goal is to have very clear standards, very well defined, so when school districts develop the curriculum to teach these contents, there\'s no question about what the students are supposed to master,” said Christopher Lilienthal, assistant director of communications at Pennsylvania’s State Education Association.</p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">But even if the human-cause factor is included in the standard, the process will not wrap up until the end of this year and the schools will have three years to fully implement them. If the standards are approved, they would likely be instituted by the 2024-25 school year. <p>' +
'<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“Our members, especially our science teachers, are really eager to see this process move forward to have in place standards and curriculum that really match the challenges that we face as a society,” said Lilienthal, who hopes the revision will provide students with “the understanding and the knowledge to be the best leaders of tomorrow.”</p>'
