'<p>To teach it, he uses a photo taken by a friend on the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds. The fairgrounds are a few miles south of where he grew up, and the building shows high water marks from four different floods in the area. The most recent line almost touches the building’s roof.</p>' +
'<p>“I\'ve grown up here in Pennsylvania. I moved here when I was in first grade. I know Pennsylvania. And I\'ve seen the changes,” he said. “I tell the kids, ‘If you warm the atmosphere and you add more moisture, that water\'s going to come down eventually. And that\'s what you\'re seeing now in these floods.”</p>'

  "<p>Some states, like Wyoming and New York, have improved upon the climate change standards presented by the NGSS. But others such as Texas and Pennsylvania “treat NGSS noticeably worse,” said Branch. “Those [states] have some of the worst treatments for climate change.”</p>" +
  "<p>The report evaluated how climate change is addressed in the NGSS standards adopted by each state, and in the science standards of those who didn’t. Researchers assigned each state a score based on the inclusion of four principles: climate change is real; it’s caused by human activity; it’s affecting nature and society and it's possible to mitigate the effects.</p>"  +
  "<p>“The bigger problem, obviously, in a lot of states, is that they just really don't talk about climate change much at all. Or if they do, they cast doubt on it,” said Dan Quinn, communications strategist at the Texas Freedom Network.</p>" +
  "<p>Some of the most populous states earned a D+ or lower. Six of these states, including Pennsylvania and Texas, received a failing grade. Researchers found that even some states who used the framework downplayed the severity of climate change as outlined in the NGSS and scored a C+ or lower. Of these, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina received an F.</p>";

  "<h3 style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Lack of national guidance</h3>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>In the United States, there is no national policy that mandates schools to teach climate change. Instead, individual states decide whether to include climate change in their science standards, which define what students should know by the end of each grade level. Only 29 states and D.C. require teaching man-made climate change, while 15 others do mention climate change but don’t specify its human cause, according to a 2020 The Aspen Institute report.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>“Unlike most of the developed world, it doesn't make any sense to talk about national education policy on climate education, because there isn't one,” said Glen Branch, the deputy director of the National Center for Science Education. “[Standards] vary greatly in their coverage, the extent of their coverage and the quality of their coverage of climate change.”</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>In April 2013, teachers, scientists and researchers partnered with 26 states to develop the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a new set of K-12 science standards that encourages critical thinking activities and connects scientific concepts to real-life situations. These introduce climate change-related topics as early as kindergarten and explicitly address the human effect on global warming at the middle and high school level.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Twenty states and D.C. have adopted the NGSS, while another 24 have written their own standards based on them. But in 6 states, which encompass nearly 30% of public school students, science standards do not follow the NGSS’s framework, according to a report from the National Center for Science Education and the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund, published in October 2020.</p>";

  "<h3>Making the grade</h3>" +
  '<p>“There’s really great progress being made, but in patches across the US, and then you still have states who are not even talking about it and denying the human causes of climate change,” said Christina Kwauk, a social scientist and climate change education at the Brookings Institute. “It\'s a huge spectrum.”</p>' +
  "<p>But what happens in the classroom doesn’t totally depend on the state’s standards. Standards outline the state's expectations for teaching and learning, but it is the curriculum that determines how the content is being taught, and that varies according to the district.</p>" +
  '<p>“Even though there are [NGSS] standards in place in some states, it\'s not always clear that those are standards that are really being addressed in a meaningful way in the classroom,” said Sarah Bodor, director of policy and affiliate relations at North American Association for Environmental Education.</p>' +
  "<p>While districts determine the curriculum, the standards guide statewide testing, which evaluates students’ performance at each grade level. In states that require teaching climate change, the standardized assessments will test students’ knowledge on the topic. But for those that don’t address it, there is no way of measuring how much those students know about the topic.</p>" +
  '<p>“Learning outcomes are essential for climate leadership, for climate engagement, civic participation, things that will make a difference, and help us hold the education system accountable to making that difference”, said Kwauk. “We really need to focus on developing those indicators and those measurement frameworks.”</p>' +
  '<p>But some teachers, like Vandenberg from Pennsylvania, who work in states that don’t require teaching climate change, believe it’s imperative to incorporate the topic into their classes.</p>' +
  "<p>Vandenberg teaches elective courses on humans and the environment and environmental science, which include curriculum focused on climate change. But even in his general chemistry classes, his students get a “full dose of climate change,” and he dedicates a few lessons to the impact of fossil fuels on the environment.</p>" +
  '<p>Ninth grade biology teacher, Jackie Falcone, also teaches the human impact of climate change. In Pennsylvania, biology classes follow the content included in the Biology Keystone Exam, an end-of-the-year assessment which informs the material Falcone includes in her lessons. </p>' +
  '<p>Though the content in the exam doesn’t specifically address human-caused climate change, Falcone chooses to emphasize its influence on the topics she covers in class. </p>' +
  '<p>“I like to make them understand that all of this is connected,” Falcone said. “Even just talking about severe storms, and the tornadoes that have been happening more frequently around here, like all of that is very tangible for the students.”</p>' +
  '<p>But not all teachers at Springfield promote instruction on the human impact of climate change. Falcone has received pushback from a social studies teacher at the school, and she said she occasionally “picks on this other teacher” as part of a “running joke.” In the past, she’s also detected some doubt from students.</p>' +
  '<p>“Some of the students have definitely asked questions where you can understand that they\'re coming from a place of preconceived notions of climate change, and it being political,” Falcone said.</p>' +
  '<p>But climate deniers or skeptics are not the majority. At least 78% of Pennsylvania residents believe schools should teach about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to global warming, according to Yale Climate Opinion Maps published last year.</p>';
